## Polyrhythmic Musical Math
In this project, we explore the intersection of math-based art and music.
We create a number of polyrhythmic art patterns (archs, along whose paths dots moe to and fro, in this case)
We map these patterns to musical notes, creating a polyrhythmic musical composition.
When the dots reach either end of their paths, they play their designated note.

This project is bootstrapped with HTML 5 Boilerplate.
